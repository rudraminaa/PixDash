okay so this world feels like something already ended before the player even arrives.

you start in this really cold winter area and it’s not just cold for difficulty reasons, it feels like the world froze itself on purpose. like it wanted to stop things from getting worse. everything is quiet and empty, and that silence feels intentional.

the player isn’t a hero. they don’t feel special. more like someone who showed up late. there’s this constant feeling that something important already happened and you’re just walking through what’s left of it.

when the snow slowly turns into a forest, it doesn’t feel peaceful. the forest is alive, but it doesn’t trust you. the trees are dense, light barely gets through, and it feels like nature took over because it had no other choice.

later, when the world turns into broken roads and abandoned urban areas, it finally clicks that humans were here. there are cracked roads, buildings falling apart, and plants growing through concrete. whatever people tried to do here didn’t work.

about the enemies:

the crows feel wrong. they watch you more than they attack. sometimes it feels like they’re not even real birds, more like watchers or leftover surveillance that doesn’t know what it’s supposed to do anymore.

the skeletons don’t feel evil either. they feel stuck. like people who died during whatever collapse happened and are just repeating their last moments without knowing why.

ice golems feel like something created on purpose. maybe humans built them to protect certain areas, and when everything went wrong, the cold kept them alive. now they just guard empty land.

the camouflaging mushrooms feel scared more than aggressive. they hide because hiding worked. maybe something hunted them before and they adapted to disappear instead of fighting back.

wolves are the most “normal” enemies. they’re just surviving. they hunt in packs, they back off when they lose, and they don’t feel like monsters at all.

overall, the game shouldn’t feel scary or intense all the time. it should feel lonely, calm, and a bit sad. the world isn’t trying to kill the player. it just doesn’t care anymore.

and maybe that’s the point.

you’re not here to save this place. you’re just walking through it, trying to understand why it ended up this way.
