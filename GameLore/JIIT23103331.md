# Opening Sequence

White.
Nothing but white.

The screen fades in slowly, revealing a soldier half-buried in snow, breath fogging the air in short, uneven bursts. Wind cuts across the land, carrying distant, indistinct sounds—metal creaking, something heavy moving far away.

The soldier forces himself upright.

A radio crackles on his chest.
Static. Then—something almost like a voice.

> “…—any unit… repeat—”

The signal dies in a burst of noise. The soldier taps the radio, turning in place. Ahead, barely visible through the snowstorm, a tall silhouette pierces the sky—a signal tower, its lights flickering weakly.

He exhales.

> “If there’s any chance… it’s there.”

As he starts forward, the camera pulls away briefly.

Far in the distance, something moves.

Not clearly. Not fully. Just a massive shape walking through the storm, slow and deliberate. Each step leaves the ground trembling. The soldier freezes, instinct taking over. He drops behind a fallen tree, pressing himself into the snow.

The shape passes.

The camera never fully reveals it.

Only the sound remains—heavy, rhythmic, too big to be natural.

Silence returns.

The soldier doesn’t wait.

# Gameplay Begins

He breaks into a sprint toward the tower.

Snow crunches violently beneath his boots. A stamina bar appears—draining fast. He vaults over fallen logs, slides under broken branches, pushing himself harder than he should.

A low growl cuts through the wind.

On the right.

A wolf emerges from the trees—too close.

> “Shit. Shit—”

The wolf lunges.

The chase begins.

The player is forced forward—no combat yet. Jumping obstacles, weaving between trees, stamina boosting speed at the cost of exhaustion. Black shapes dive from above—crows, slashing once, twice, forcing the player to react.

The tower is close now.

But so is something else.

A rusted shed appears to the left, half-collapsed, door barely hanging on its hinges.

The soldier swerves.

The wolf snaps at his heels as he throws himself inside, slamming the door shut just in time. Claws scrape against metal. More growls join in from outside.

Then—

Silence.

## Inside the Shed

The soldier leans against the door, breathing hard.

The shed is dark. Claustrophobic. A single light flickers overhead.

This is the first safe space.

Crates. Lockers. Old equipment. A chance to loot, to learn, to prepare. The radio crackles again—still unusable, but not dead.

Outside, something moves past the shed.

Not the wolves.

Something heavier.

And the game truly begins.
The soldier grips his weapon.
An
And the game truly begins.
