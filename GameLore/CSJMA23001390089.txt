# Lore Brainstorm: "The Quiet After the Melt"

Just dumping some thoughts on the story/vibes here.

The main idea: I don't think the world ended all at once. It just... slowed down. Froze. Forgot itself.

**The Player**
You're not really a "hero". You might not even be alive? You just wake up in the cold biome with no intro, no name. You just know how to move.
It feels like you've been here before. Or maybe the world remembers you, but like... barely.

**The Winter Biome**
This place feels like someone hit the pause button mid-disaster.
- **Ice Golems:** They aren't guards. They're leftovers. Old construction machines or emergency bots that froze over? They only move if you bug them.
- **Skeletons:** They're buried in snowdrifts, no armor or weapons. They weren't fighting, they were *waiting*.

*Idea for an early text pop-up:*
> "The cold doesn’t kill you immediately.
> It convinces you to stop trying."

**The Forest**
Snow thins out, but the plants look wrong.
- **Mushrooms:** They camouflage so well. My theory? They learned to hide from people, not animals. 
- **Wolves:** They don't hunt in packs, they stalk you. It feels purposeful. Like a test.

**The City (Asphalt Zone)**
This is where it gets uncomfortable. 
- **The Crows:** I honestly don't think they're birds. They act like cameras. They watch you from the streetlights and antennas. Maybe they're the reason the forest knows you're coming?
- **Signs:** "TEMPORARY EVACUATION ZONE" (but it's clearly been centuries).

**Overall Vibe**
Lonely, but not empty.
The game isn't asking "Can you survive?".
It's asking: **"Should you have come back?"**
