WHO IS THE PLAYER AND WHY THEY ARE HERE ??
The player is one of many children left behind after a sudden and unexplained abandonment of a city. The adults did not flee in panic; they left deliberately, sealing doors, cutting systems short, and never returning. The children were not told why.
At first, survival feels improvised but manageable. The children form groups, create rules based on half-remembered instructions, and slowly adapt to an environment that no longer protects them. Danger exists, but it feels external — animals, strange systems, unfamiliar terrain.
Over time, however, the threat begins to feel closer.
Resources disappear. Enemies appear where they shouldn’t. Safety rules stop working. The children begin to believe that something inside the group is causing it.
The player is not a hero or a leader. They are simply present — old enough to understand more than the others, but not enough to fully intervene. Their silence, hesitation, or small choices influence how fear spreads.
The “enemy” among the children is never clearly identified. It may be real, misunderstood, or entirely imagined. What matters is not whether the threat exists, but that the group becomes convinced it does.

To survive, the children begin to exclude.
Not with violence, but with rules:
-who is allowed inside
-who gets food
-who is too risky to keep
-No one says they are hurting anyone.
-They say they are being careful.
As the world grows quieter and safer, it also grows colder. Laughter fades. Play disappears. Survival improves, but trust does not.
The player slowly realizes that the greatest danger in the abandoned world is not the environment — it is how fear reshapes people when no one is left to stop it.
